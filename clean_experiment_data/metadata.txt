These files correspond to the manuscript: 
Matthes, J.H., A.K. Lang, F.V. Jevon, S.J. Russell. Tree stress and mortality from emerald ash borer does not systematically alter short-term soil carbon flux in a mixed northeastern U.S. forest. Submitted to Forests, 21 Dec 2017.


EAB_SoilFlux_CO2CH4flux.csv 
Contains the measured soil-atmosphere trace gas measurements that were modeled as CO2 and CH4 flux. The code for processing the raw trace gas measurements into flux values is hosted at: GITHUB

Variables:
collar_id: replicate identifier for each unique soil collar measured in the experiment
tree_id: identifier for each unique EAB-impacted tree in the experiment
year: YYYY of measured flux
year_month: YYYY-mm of measured flux
date: YYYY-mm-dd of measured flux
CO2_flux_umolm-2s-1: measured CO2 flux in micro moles of carbon per m^2 per s^1 
CH4_flux_umolm-2s-1: measured CH4 flux in micro moles of carbon per m^2 per s^1 
soil_temp_C: soil temperature in celsius, measured at 10cm soil depth at the time of flux measurement
soil_moisture_vol: volumetric soil water content (m^3 m^-3) measured with a time domain reflectometry probe at either 10cm (2016) or 12cm (2017) depth at the time of flux measurement


EAB_SoilFlux_Covariates.csv
Contains the soil covariates measured after harvesting the soil core within the measurement collar at the conclusion of the experiment (October 2017). 

Variables:
collar_id: replicate identifier for each unique soil collar measured in the experiment
pH: soil pH measured with a 2:1 distilled water dilution 
root biomass_g: total dry biomass of roots > 1mm collected through sieving and dried in a 45C oven for 72 hours
clay_frac: fraction soil clay content (<0.002 mm) for a 2mL subsample of the soil mineral fraction measured on a laser diffraction particle size analyzer
silt_frac: fraction soil clay content (0.002-0.05 mm) for a 2mL subsample of the soil mineral fraction measured on a laser diffraction particle size analyzer
sand_frac: fraction soil clay content (0.05-2 mm) for a 2mL subsample of the soil mineral fraction measured on a laser diffraction particle size analyzer


EAB_SoilFlux_TreeHealth.csv
Contains the EAB status classes for trees in the study measured in July 2016 and 2017, with DBH measured in 2016.

Variables:
collar_id: replicate identifier for each unique soil collar measured in the experiment
tree_id: identifier for each unique EAB-impacted tree in the experiment
year: YYYY of survey
status: healthy, impacted by EAB, or dead by EAB
dbh: stem diameter at 1.3 m from the ground surface in cm
condition: transition classes for the tree from 2016 to 2017, where H-I is healthy to impacted, I-I is staying impacted, I-D is impacted to dead, and D-D is dead from the start of the experiment
